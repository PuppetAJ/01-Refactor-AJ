# Code Refactor Challenge

## Contents
This is Adrian Jimenez's code refactor challenge submission. 

Throughout this project, I reorganized the original HTML and CSS code to make it more readable. In addition, I changed overused divs into semantic elements for 
accessibility purposes, and fixed the broken links in the nav section. Lastly, I consolidated unnecessarily repeated CSS rules and classes into the least amount 
possible for the code to function. 

Once I completed this task I deployed the project onto GitHub Pages.
